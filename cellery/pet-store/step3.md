We have the Cellery project prepared for you with all the cell files and the source files.  

This sample is structured into two Cells.  
1. Pet-be Cell
2. Pet-fe Cell

#### Pet-be (Backend Cell)

This contains the four components which involve working with the Pet Store data and also the business logic. This Cell has an HTTP Ingress to expose the APIs.

#### Pet-fe (Frontend Cell)

This contains a single component which serves the Portal. The Portal is exposed through a Web Cell which is able to provide SSO and Web Content delivery features.

Take your time and explore the files that are generated for you.
